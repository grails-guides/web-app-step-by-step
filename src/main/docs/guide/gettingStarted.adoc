In the https://objectcomputing.com/resources/publications/sett/april-2017-web-app-step-by-step[April 2017 issue of SETT], my colleague https://github.com/mvolkmann[Mark Volkmann] laid out a
detailed blueprint for developing a modern web application, from
beginning to end. In this article, we will demonstrate how to develop
the same web app, using the Grails framework. The only explicit
technology change we will be making will be the use of Grails over
Node/express for the backend - otherwise we will use the same stack,
including React and PostgresSQL. However, we will see how Grails
simplifies and accelerates the development process and makes developers
more productive without giving up finer grain control where needed.

The emphasis of this article will not be so much learning how the
“innards” of how web applications work, but rather on _developer
productivity_. In addition, we will refer readers to Mark’s article for
details on the implementation of the React application, as there we will
be using almost the exact same code (any changes will be highlighted and
explained).
